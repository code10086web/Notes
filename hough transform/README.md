## Hough transform note

#### Hough forests

training -> probablistic vote

regress the displacement vector to reference point & object class

> 

#### VoteNet

end2end train: sampling (PointNet) -> voting -> clustering -> proposal (PointNet)

supervision of center, heading angle, box size, semantic classification

> 

#### Survey

Standard HT: accumulate all parameter $a$ such that $f(x,a)=0$

Generalized HT: construct R-table to reference point

Randomized HT:  many to one mapping
